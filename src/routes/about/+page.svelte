	<h1>We're Megaphone.</h1>
	<p>
		As our name implies, our mission is to give people a voice...
		At the same time, we know the internet can be a toxic, dangerous place.
		While allowing people to be heard and creating a safe environment sound like two conflicting goals,
		we are confident that it is possible. While our platform's Terms of Service sound harsh,
		it's really just a verbose way of saying "please be nice".
	</p>
	<p>
		At least, that's what we would say if we were serious about this. Megaphone is one of <Link href="https://youtube.com/@jtpotato">my</Link>
		silly projects, and I doubt any of what I just said above is true. Do have a look around anyway.
